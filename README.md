# Social Profile QR Generator

*"Contre la bêtise moderne"* - Against the tedium of misspelled names and failed LinkedIn searches.

A simple web tool to generate QR codes for your LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram profiles. 
Perfect for conferences, meetups, and networking events.

## Why This Exists

Networking shouldn't be hard. You meet someone interesting, you want to connect, 
but then comes the awkward dance:

- "What's your name again?"
- "How do you spell that?"
- "Are you the John Smith from Boston or the other one?"
- *5 minutes of searching later...*

This tool fixes that. Generate a QR code, save it to your phone, show it when needed. 
Instant connection. No friction.

## Features

✨ Three major platforms: LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram
🔒 100% local - nothing uploaded, no tracking
📱 Mobile-optimized - made for real-world use
⚡ Instant generation - paste URL, get QR
💾 Download or share directly to WhatsApp
🎯 Smart validation - checks URLs match the platform
